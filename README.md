# loan_prediction
Problem Statement: It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not

1.Some of the factors can affect the loan approval:

-Applicants with high income should have more chances of loan approval.

-Applicants who have repayed their previous debts should have higher chances of loan approval.

-Loan approval should also depend on the loan amount. If the loan amount is less, chances of loan approval should be high.

-Loan for less time period and less amount should have higher chances of approval.

-Lesser the amount to be paid monthly to repay the loan, higher the chances of loan approval

2.After model building XGBoost classifiers leads to better predictions
